`Reserapi` is the dedicated backend for `Reservio`: an intuitive room booking application. It is made using laravel, but has its own user interface.

With the creation of `Reserapi`, I hereby commiting myself to finish this application until an appropriate balance of usability, features, and aesthetic is reached.

I'll be using as much of the best practices in building this application as possible, in good faith that it may be useful for the times to come.

Next up: creating page for new reservation.
